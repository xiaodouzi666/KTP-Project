Counselor: Hello, welcome to the consultation room. My name is Xiao Huang, and I am a psychological counselor. You came to me today to talk about your recent unstable mentality and inability to learn, right?

Interviewee: Yes. I feel very stressed recently, and my academic performance has also declined. I don’t know what to do.

Counselor: I can understand your current mood. The pressure of entering a higher school does make people feel anxious and uneasy. Can you tell me more about your recent feelings?

Interviewee: I feel that I can’t get motivated to do anything, and it’s hard to concentrate. Even if I study hard, I feel that I can’t learn.

Counselor: How long have you been in this situation?

Interviewee: About two months.

Counselor: Before this, have your academic performance always been good?

Interviewee: Yes. I have always been an excellent student in the class, and studying has always been easy for me.

Counselor: Then this drop in grades must be a big blow to you, right?

Interviewee: Yes. I feel like a failure and I feel sorry for my parents.

Counselor: Can you tell me more about your guilt towards your parents?

Interviewee: They have always hoped that I could get into a key university, but I feel like I have disappointed them now.

Counselor: Do your parents know about your current situation?

Interviewee: I don’t know yet. I’m afraid they will worry, so I have never dared to tell them.

Counselor: You hide your stress in your heart, which will make you feel even worse. In fact, you can try to communicate with your parents and seek their support and understanding.

Interviewee: I’ll try.

Counselor: In addition to the pressure of study, do you have other troubles recently?

Interviewee: I feel that my relationship with my classmates and friends is not very good.

Counselor: Can you tell me more about it?

Interviewee: I feel that they don’t understand me, and it is difficult for me to fit in with their circle.

Counselor: Have you tried to take the initiative to communicate with them?

Interviewee: I tried, but it felt awkward.

Counselor: Social skills also need to be learned and practiced. You can try to join some community activities, or find some like-minded friends to communicate with.

Interviewee: I will try to do it.

Counselor: We have talked so much today, how do you feel?

Interviewee: I feel a little more relaxed, and I understand some of my problems.

Counselor: I am glad to hear you say that. You have to remember that you are not alone, we will all encounter difficulties and setbacks. The important thing is that you have to learn how to face and overcome them.

Interviewee: Thank you, I will.

Counselor: If you have any questions in the future, you can always come to me.

Interviewee: OK, thank you.
