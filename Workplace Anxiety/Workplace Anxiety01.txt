Psychological counseling interview

Counselor: An experienced counselor
Interviewee: A white-collar worker working in Shanghai

Counselor: Hello, please take a seat. My name is [Counselor's name], and I am a counselor. I am glad that you can come to interview me today.

Interviewee: Yes, hello.

Counselor: I understand that you are a white-collar worker working in Shanghai. You have been feeling very stressed at work recently. Your boss always arranges unreasonable work for you. Your salary has not increased for several months, and your life pressure is getting bigger and bigger. You also mentioned that you have a bad temper and like to swear. Could you please describe your feelings in detail?

Interviewee: I feel like I am about to be crushed. I am very tired at work every day, and I have to face various requirements from my boss. I often work overtime until late at night, and I don't even have time to rest. Moreover, my salary has not increased for several months, but the rent and prices have been rising. I feel that life is getting more and more difficult.

Counselor: It is normal for you to feel stressed and anxious. You have encountered some difficulties at work, which has affected your mood. I can understand your feelings.

Interviewee: Thank you for your understanding. I really don't know what to do now. I feel like I'm about to collapse.

Counselor: Don't worry, we can slowly solve these problems together. First, let's analyze the specific difficulties you encounter at work.

Counselor: You think the work arranged by the leader is unreasonable. In which specific aspects do you mean?

Interviewee: The leader often arranges some work beyond my ability and asks me to work overtime to complete it. I think these jobs are too difficult for me and there is no meaning.

Counselor: Have you communicated with the leader about these problems?

Interviewee: I have communicated, but it's useless. The leader always says that I am not capable enough and asks me to work hard. I am speechless.

Counselor: You can try to communicate with the leader more deeply. For example, you can explain to the leader why you think these tasks are unreasonable and how you hope to solve these problems.

Interviewee: I'll try.

Counselor: In addition to the pressure at work, you also mentioned that the pressure of life is increasing. Can you describe your living conditions in detail?

Interviewee: My salary is not high, but the rent is very high. Almost all of my monthly income is spent on rent, and the remaining money is not enough for living. I also have to pay for my parents' living expenses, so I am under a lot of pressure.

Counselor: You can try to find some part-time jobs to increase your income. You can also communicate with your parents to let them know about your financial situation and seek their support.

Interviewee: I will consider it.

Counselor: You also mentioned that you have a bad temper and like to swear. What kind of impact do you think this will have on you?

Interviewee: I know this is not good, but I can't control my emotions. I often get angry because of some trivial things, and then I can't help but swear.

Counselor: Emotions are difficult to control, but we can learn some ways to manage our emotions. For example, you can try deep breathing, meditation and other methods to relax yourself. You can also learn some communication skills and learn how to express your emotions better.

Interviewee: I will try it.
