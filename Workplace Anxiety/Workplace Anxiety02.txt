Consultant: Teacher Li, national second-level psychological counselor, with 10 years of psychological counseling experience

The psychological counseling room is warm and comfortable, furnished with sofas, coffee tables, desk lamps, etc.

Consultant: Hello, Mr. Wang, welcome to my counseling room. You have an appointment for consultation today, what do you want to talk about?

Interviewee: Hello, Teacher Li. I feel very stressed recently, and I have encountered some difficulties in work and life.

Consultant: Okay, please tell me more about your feelings and troubles.

Interviewee: I work at Alibaba and am a senior software engineer. Recently, there are many work projects, and I often need to work overtime until 9 or 10 o'clock in the evening, and I have to work on weekends. In addition, the leader often arranges some unreasonable work tasks, which makes me feel very anxious and irritable.

Consultant: You mentioned that the work rhythm is tight and the leader arranges unreasonable work tasks. These factors do cause a lot of pressure. How do you deal with it?

Interviewee: To be honest, I don’t know what to do. Sometimes I complain to my colleagues, and sometimes I vent my anger alone.

Counselor: I can understand your mood. When the pressure is too great, emotions are easy to get out of control. However, long-term suppression or venting of emotions may have adverse effects on your physical and mental health.

Interviewee: I am aware of this problem and want to change.

Counselor: I am very happy to hear that you want to change. I can teach you some methods of emotion management, such as deep breathing, meditation, mindfulness, etc. When you feel stressed, you can use these methods to calm yourself down first, and then deal with the problem rationally.

Interviewee: OK.

Counselor: In addition to work pressure, you also mentioned that you have encountered some difficulties in life. Can you tell me more about it?

Interviewee: My family conditions are not very good. My parents are migrant workers. It is not easy for me to go to college. I have to pay the mortgage every month and send money home, so the financial pressure is very high.

Counselor: Do you have any plans for your future?

Interviewee: To be honest, I am very confused now and don’t know what to do.

Counselor: You can set a small goal for yourself first, such as stabilizing your job and improving your skills, and then consider other things.

Interviewee: Yes, I will.

Counselor: You mentioned earlier that the leader often arranges unreasonable work tasks, which makes you feel very irritated. Have you communicated with the leader?

Interviewee: I have communicated, but it has no effect. The leader always says that the work tasks are heavy and there are not enough people.

Counselor: You can try to communicate more effectively with the leader. For example, you can organize a work plan, list the tasks and time arrangements that need to be completed in the near future, discuss with the leader, and make some reasonable suggestions, such as postponing or canceling some unnecessary work, or assigning some work to other colleagues.

Interviewee: Okay, I'll try.

Counselor: In addition, you can also try to find some other job opportunities. The Internet industry is developing rapidly now, and there are many opportunities. You can choose a job that suits you better according to your interests and abilities.

Interviewee: Yes, I will consider it.

In the following consultation, Teacher Li will develop a personalized consultation plan based on Mr. Wang’s specific situation to help him relieve stress, improve his emotional management skills, and explore career development directions.
