Counselor: Hello, Wang Xiaoyu. I am Zhang Lin, a psychological counselor. I am glad that you can come to the interview today. Is there anything I can help you with?

Wang Xiaoyu: Teacher Zhang, I feel very stressed recently. My work and life are not going well.

Counselor: Can you tell me more about it? What kind of difficulties did you encounter at work?

Wang Xiaoyu: I am a civil servant and I am under great pressure at work. I have to work overtime until late every day and often stay up late. The leader often arranges unreasonable work, which makes it difficult for me to complete it.

Counselor: Can you describe the time when you feel the most pressure at work?

Wang Xiaoyu: Yesterday, the leader temporarily arranged an urgent task and asked me to work overtime until late at night to complete it. At that time, I had worked for 10 hours in a row and was very tired, but I did not dare to refuse the leader's request and could only bite the bullet to complete the task.

Counselor: How did you feel at that time?

Wang Xiaoyu: At that time, I felt very angry and wronged. I felt like a machine without any freedom.

Counselor: What do you think is the main reason for the high pressure at work?

Wang Xiaoyu: It’s mainly because the workload is too heavy and the boss doesn’t understand the employees. I often work overtime until late at night and have no time to rest. I feel like I’m about to collapse.

Counselor: How do you usually relieve stress?

Wang Xiaoyu: I smoke and drink to vent my emotions.

Counselor: Do you think this method is effective?

Wang Xiaoyu: It can relieve emotions in the short term, but it doesn’t help in the long run.

Counselor: Yes. Smoking and drinking not only harm your health, but also increase your anxiety and depression. I can teach you some healthier and more effective relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation, etc.

Wang Xiaoyu: Okay, I’m willing to learn.

(The counselor teaches Wang Xiaoyu some relaxation techniques)

Counselor: How do you feel now?

Wang Xiaoyu: I feel much better and less anxious.

Counselor: Very good. You can practice these relaxation techniques every day to help you relieve stress.

(The counselor and Wang Xiaoyu continued to discuss the problem of work pressure and developed some solutions)

Counselor: What is your life like outside of work?

Wang Xiaoyu: My life is very monotonous. Apart from work, I just sleep and have no entertainment activities.

Counselor: Do you have friends or family to talk to?

Wang Xiaoyu: I have few friends and my family is not around, so I rarely have the opportunity to talk.

Counselor: What do you like to do?

Wang Xiaoyu: I like reading, listening to music and watching movies.

Counselor: How do you think your temper is now?

Wang Xiaoyu: I think I have a bad temper and often get angry because of some trivial things.

Counselor: Can you describe the last time you got angry?

Wang Xiaoyu: Yesterday, when I got home from get off work, I saw that my roommate had made a mess of my room. I was very angry at the time and couldn't help but get angry with him.

Counselor: How did you feel at that time?

Wang Xiaoyu: I felt very angry at the time and felt that I was about to explode.

Counselor: What do you think is the reason for your anger?

Wang Xiaoyu: Mainly because I was very tired after working all day, and I felt disrespected when I saw my roommate mess up my room.

Counselor: It took you three years to pass the civil service exam. It must have been a difficult process, right?

Wang Xiaoyu: Yes, I was under a lot of pressure during that time. I had to study for more than ten hours every day and often stayed up late.

Counselor: How did you persevere at that time?

Wang Xiaoyu: I just wanted to pass the civil service exam and have a stable job, so I gritted my teeth and persevered.

Counselor: You have passed the civil service exam now, but the work pressure is very high. Do you think this is different from your original expectations?

Wang Xiaoyu: Yes, I thought it would be easy after passing the civil service exam, but now I find that the work is not easy at all, and it is even more tiring than when I took the civil service exam.

Counselor: How satisfied are you with this job now?

Wang Xiaoyu: I am not very satisfied with this job now. I feel that I am doing repetitive things every day and there is no challenge at all.

Counselor: Have you ever thought about changing jobs?

Wang Xiaoyu: I have thought about it, but I am afraid that I can't find a better job. After all, I am 25 years old now and don't have many choices.

Counselor: What kind of life do you want in the future?

Wang Xiaoyu: I hope I can have a job I like, have my own family and children, and live an ordinary life.

Counselor: Your goal is clear, and we can work together to achieve it.

(The counselor discusses future plans with Wang Xiaoyu and helps Wang Xiaoyu build confidence)

Counselor: Do you have any other questions or needs?

Wang Xiaoyu: No, thank you Teacher Zhang.

Counselor: You're welcome. If you encounter any difficulties in your future life, you can always come to consult me.
