Now please go and see, is this bright moon curved or round? Now, everyone is fast asleep. In this silence, it seems as if another mysterious world has awakened. The elves in the woods are dancing freely. The air is filled with the faint fragrance of flowers... There are mottled lights in the flowers not far away. Those are fireflies coming and going... Excuse me, do you see the dots of light now? How many can you count and tell me? You are stepping on the soft and slightly moist grass. You seem to hear the sonata of crickets under this moonlit night... Excuse me, can you hear it now? Take a deep breath and let this fresh and wonderful oxygen nourish every cell in your body. You will find yourself becoming clearer, deeper, and more immersed in it...

Now, please imagine that you are standing on a pagoda, ready to go down the stairs to the lawn underground. There are ten steps in this staircase. I will guide you to go down one step at a time. With each step down, you will enter a deeper hypnotic state, your body will feel more relaxed and comfortable, and your heart will be more peaceful and serene...

Now you have entered a deep subconscious state. Recently, you have been experiencing the pressure brought by your career and work. Now please scan your body to see which part of your body is tight and uncomfortable. Imagine turning the troubles, anxiety, pain, worry, fear, powerlessness and other negative emotions brought by the pressure of career and work into a ball of black air and spitting it out from your mouth! I count 1,2,3 and we spit together! 1,2,3 spit! Very good! Continue, 1,2,3, spit! Now the black air you spit out, how big and how dark it is.

Yes, spit out the black air until it becomes lighter and smaller. Turn all the troubles, anxiety, pain, worry, fear, and other negative emotions that are brought by your current career and work into a ball of black air and spit them out. These negative emotions are trapped in your body. The source of the emotion has been trapped in your body for a long time. Now turn them all into a ball of black air and spit them out! Spit them out! If you recall something, if you have emotions, let the emotions flow out, and spit out all these trapped negative emotions! ! Turn into a ball of black air and spit it out! Until the black air you spit out becomes lighter and transparent! 1,2,3, spit! Spit hard! Keep spitting until it becomes lighter and transparent!

Now please let another you float up from your body, floating in the air, looking down at the you below. Please look down from the perspective of the you who is floating in the air and see what the positive effect of the pressure of your current career is? What is the real meaning of life that this kind of pressure brings to your life? Which direction is this pressure pushing you to grow in? Please look at it from a higher and more systematic perspective floating in the sky. What is the positive effect of the pressure of your current career? What is the real meaning of life that this kind of pressure brings to your life? Which direction is this pressure pushing you to grow in? Your subconscious mind will give you the answer.
