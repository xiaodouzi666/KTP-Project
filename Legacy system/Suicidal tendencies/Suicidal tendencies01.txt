Interview content:

Consultant: Hello, Li Ming. I am Wang Yu, a psychological counselor. I am very happy that you can come to the interview today. Is there anything I can help you with?

Li Ming: Hello, Teacher Wang. I feel very stressed recently, my life is not satisfactory, and I want to commit suicide.

Consultant: Can you tell me more about it? What difficulties have you encountered recently?

Li Ming: I failed the postgraduate entrance examination three times, and my family has been urging me to find a job. I recently broke up with my girlfriend. I feel that I am useless and there is no meaning in living.

Consultant: Can you describe your current mood?

Li Ming: I feel very depressed and desperate now, and I feel like I am about to collapse.

Counselor: Have you ever thought about how to commit suicide?

Li Ming: I thought about jumping off a building, and I also thought about taking medicine to commit suicide.

Counselor: How strong is your suicidal idea?

Li Ming: Very strong, I think about suicide every day now.

Counselor: Can you tell me why you want to commit suicide?

Li Ming: I feel that I have no value in this world, no one cares about me, and I don’t want to suffer like this anymore.

Counselor: I understand your feelings. You are at the lowest point in your life now, and you feel very painful, but suicide is not the solution to the problem. We can work together to find a solution to the problem.

(The counselor established a good consulting relationship with Li Ming and expressed his understanding and support for him)

Counselor: You failed the postgraduate entrance examination three times. What do you think is the reason?

Li Ming: I think it may be because I didn’t study hard enough and didn’t find a study method that suits me.

Counselor: What do your family members think of your postgraduate entrance examination?

Li Ming: They have always supported me in my postgraduate entrance examination, but I failed this time and they are very disappointed.

Counselor: What is the reason for your breakup with your girlfriend?

Li Ming: We are not compatible, and she thinks I am too unpromising, so she broke up with me.

Counselor: How is your life now?

Li Ming: I stay at home every day and don’t want to do anything. I feel like a walking corpse.

Counselor: How do you usually relieve stress?

Li Ming: I smoke and drink to vent my emotions.

Counselor: Do you think this method is effective?

Li Ming: It can relieve emotions in the short term, but it is not helpful in the long run.

(The counselor deeply understands Li Ming’s situation and analyzes the reasons for his suicide)

Counselor: What do you think is your biggest problem now?

Li Ming: I think my biggest problem is lack of confidence. I feel that I can’t do anything well.

Counselor: Why do you have so little confidence in yourself?

Li Ming: It may be because I failed the postgraduate entrance examination, or it may be because I have experienced too many setbacks recently.

Counselor: What kind of life do you want in the future?

Li Ming: I hope I can find a stable job and have a happy family.

Counselor: Your goal is clear, we can work together to achieve it.
