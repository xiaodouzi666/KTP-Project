This is a friend I met in 2012, a student troubled by obsessive thoughts. Between 2012 and 2013, I had some conversations with him. I have excerpted portions of those dialogues and formatted them appropriately, hoping to provide some inspiration to others with obsessive-compulsive disorder.

A: Hello, senior. Last week, when I was in great pain, I still managed to go and take my graduation photos. It felt really bad, but I pushed through it. Afterward, I went back to my dorm alone to do laundry, and suddenly, I had a realization about the meaning of "facts are facts." It hit me that the fact is I feel terrible right now—that’s the reality. No matter what feelings arise, they are facts. These feelings are out of my control, and that’s also a fact. So, I just went on to do what I needed to do. It’s hard to put into words, but at that moment, I felt like I’d never go back to my old ways. But now, I’m experiencing setbacks. It seems like my previous realizations are no longer helpful. I can’t even focus on reading anymore. I feel that trying to figure things out isn’t as effective as taking action directly. I’m really confused right now, and I want to hear your thoughts.

Tianji: Yes, Morita Masatake said, "Renew yourself every day." If you think you can solve today’s problems with past realizations, it’s unlikely to work. You have to learn from daily life practice and keep gaining new insights. You’ve understood the essence of "facts are facts" quite well—that’s exactly how it is. When you’re in a bad mood, it’s normal to find it hard to concentrate on reading. The key is to understand that it’s impossible to always feel calm and happy. Once you realize this, even when you feel very distressed, you can still persist in doing your tasks. Over time, the troubled feelings will pass naturally. When you encounter problems in study or life, try to communicate more with classmates or family. This is very important. Sometimes when I feel confused, I ask my family and realize it’s something many people experience. It’s just me overthinking it, and I suddenly feel much better.

A: I’ve decided to persist and let time bring change. Thank you, senior. You’ve helped me a lot. When I told my classmates about my situation, they said they had similar experiences.

Tianji: If you have any questions in the future, we can discuss them. Relying solely on your own realizations may take a long time, and it might not work. By communicating with others, borrowing their strength, you can avoid many detours and save a lot of time.

June 2, 2012
A: Senior, "Renew yourself every day" has really awakened me from my dream.

A: Also, I believe truly understanding "facts are facts" can make a big difference. Let me explain my understanding: no matter how we feel or what thoughts come to mind, as long as we do the work and complete the task, that’s the fact. For example, whether I’m happy or unhappy, the fact is that I finished the task. That’s my understanding for now, so please point out if there are any mistakes.

A: It’s so great to have meaningful exchanges like this. Based on my understanding, people say to endure the pain and persist in doing what needs to be done. But I think this isn’t entirely accurate—it has a major flaw. We may start doing things with the goal of eliminating symptoms. While we know this approach works, we might unconsciously focus too much on this goal. We end up asking ourselves, "Why am I still like this despite doing this?" or "What will help eliminate my symptoms?" I think we first need to understand our inner desires—the root cause of our pain. We should follow those desires to do what we want to do, what we can do, and what we ought to do despite the symptoms, rather than doing things solely to eliminate the symptoms.

A: Senior, I’ve found that instead of searching for knowledge in books, taking immediate action is more direct. No matter how well you understand the knowledge in books, it’s useless unless you apply it. True understanding comes from practice.

Tianji: Actually, the urge to plan things in advance is also a natural psychological reaction. When you unconsciously ask yourself, "What will help eliminate symptoms?" or "Why am I still like this?" I’ve had similar experiences. Back then, I often told myself, "Don’t think about these things," and wondered why I kept saying that to myself. I even asked myself, "Can I stop telling myself this?" Later, I realized I’d fallen into another trap. Having such thoughts or saying "don’t think about it" is normal, but we mistakenly interpret these occurrences as evidence of abnormality, which increases our pain.

Your explanation of "facts are facts" is a bit complicated. You could simplify it to: even if we feel terrible, we still have the ability to complete tasks—that’s the fact. Many people with neurosis fail to acknowledge this. For example, some say they’re in too much pain to do anything. But this distorts the fact. Their hands can move, their feet can move, and their bodies are not ill, so how can they say they can’t do anything? The reality is they don’t want to do anything, but to justify their inaction, they claim they can’t.

The translation will continue below.

A: I think I understand now. So, no matter what thoughts arise, they’re all normal and factual, meaning I should fully accept them. But what about actions?

Tianji: There’s not much theory to explain about actions. Regardless of whether you’re in a good mood or a bad mood, as long as you complete the task, that’s enough.

A: Got it. I’ll try practicing this in the coming days.

June 9, 2012
A: Hello, senior.
I feel extremely lost right now. I finished the college entrance exams, but during the exam, I was constantly focused on my state of mind. For those two days, I barely slept and probably didn’t perform well. What bothered me most wasn’t the exams themselves but my neurotic symptoms. Before the exams, I told my classmates about my condition, but afterward, I deeply regretted it. I was terrified—what would they think of me? Since then, I haven’t dared to do the things I want to do. I feel despair. Sometimes, I even wonder if I’m still alive. What should I do with my life? I’ve locked myself at home and don’t want to go out or meet anyone.

I’ve been studying Morita Therapy for almost a year, working so hard, so very hard. Life is so painful, but I don’t want to give up. I want to live well. Please, senior, help me. Right now, I have nothing left. I need someone to pull me out of this. Nobody around me understands me. You’re the only person I can think of. I’m begging you.

Tianji: From now on, don’t discuss your neurotic symptoms with others. No matter what you say, they won’t truly understand. Talking about it will only make you more aware of your symptoms, deepening your pain.

What’s done is done—don’t dwell on it. The reason you’re so afraid and distressed now is that you’re too focused on yourself. When all your mental energy is directed inward, how can you not feel pain?

Because of this excessive self-focus, you’ve become self-centered. Am I right? Think about it: apart from focusing on yourself, do you spend time caring for your parents or friends?

As for insomnia, I used to suffer from it too. I would lie awake thinking about things late into the night. But in your case, there’s another problem: you want to sleep to escape reality. First, the more you want to sleep, the more tense your mind becomes. Second, it’s impossible not to think about anything before sleeping—thinking before bed is normal. The more you try not to think, the more concentrated your mind becomes, and the harder it is to sleep. Third, trying to escape won’t make the pain disappear. In fact, the more you avoid it, the more bitter reality feels, and the more serious your symptoms become. This escapist attitude is why neurotic symptoms can’t be cured.

You didn’t get the girl you liked because you avoided expressing your feelings. You feared rejection and held back, letting someone else step in. How is this unfair? Isn’t this self-centered thinking? I’m speaking critically because I hope you can see yourself clearly. Life is inherently full of setbacks, failures, and pain—these are unavoidable. Yet, people with neurotic tendencies always wish to turn the impossible into the possible. How can that not be painful?

Accept this reality: you have to endure the pain honestly. What’s important is not to let yourself idle. Do something—household chores, a summer job—anything. Don’t avoid seeing people just because you don’t feel like it. I’ve been in your shoes, thinking I couldn’t face anyone. But when I actually went out, I realized those thoughts were just subjective assumptions. If you find it too difficult, ask a family member to accompany you.

June 10, 2012
A: Alright, I’ll try.
I plan to make a change, even though I’m not sure if it’s right or wrong. I’ll just act and see.
I’ll put the past behind me and focus on what needs to be done.

Tianji: Yes, remember: don’t avoid the pain. No matter how painful it gets, don’t stop moving forward. Do what needs to be done—that’s the right attitude toward life.

A: Yes, I’ll work hard.

June 17, 2012
A: Hello, senior.
I recently started working at my sister’s place, but for the past three days, although I’ve gone to the factory every day and worked hard to contribute, I haven’t accomplished much. I don’t know anything and have to learn everything from scratch. I want to learn a lot, but I feel like I’m learning nothing. I’m rushing too much, trying to master everything in just a few days, but I’ve achieved nothing so far. I’ve been spending the days mostly playing around, yet I come home feeling exhausted. Why is this happening? I don’t get it...

Today, I decided to stop rushing. I’ll set a specific goal: learning graphic design.

Tianji: Remember to face facts as they are. From what you’ve said, there are contradictions. On one hand, you say you’re playing around every day; on the other, you claim you’re exhausted from learning. So, what’s the reality?

Learning anything requires going through a tough process—there’s no shortcut. Stop expecting to pick it up quickly and effortlessly. Narrowing your focus to one area is a good step forward. I hope you dedicate yourself to learning with determination.

A: Because I want to learn everything, I end up dabbling here and there. While observing the employees, I feel reluctant to disturb them, so I try to self-study online. But at the end of the day, I achieve so little that it feels like I’ve just been playing around.

Tianji: In the past, I might have thought like you. People with neurotic tendencies often say, "I feel like this" or "I feel like that," but these feelings are usually imagined. If it were me, I’d describe these past few days as "exploring and learning" rather than "playing around." Over time, you’ll realize how important it is to state the facts accurately.

The continuation will follow.

June 22, 2012
Tianji: The biggest difference between doing what should be done ("acting as one ought") and doing whatever one pleases ("acting as one wishes") is that the latter doesn’t consider the impact on others. Before doing anything, you must think about whether it might affect others. Simply following your desires without regard for others often leads to self-centeredness.

A: Yes, I understand. But I also think that if we constantly worry about how others perceive us and what they say about us, we might lose focus on our tasks. Isn’t obsessing over others’ opinions also a form of self-centeredness? I can’t quite figure this out.

Tianji: Yes, constantly worrying about others’ opinions is indeed a form of self-centeredness because it’s still all about your gain or loss. Gradually, you stop paying attention to the people and things around you, and self-centeredness takes root.

June 25, 2012
A: Senior, I have a question and will keep it short. I’m working at my sister’s place, helping her with her online store. Since it’s just starting up, there’s hardly any business. I’ve been self-learning graphic design, and I’ve made some progress, but I still feel like I’m not contributing much.

To be honest, my dream has always been to start my own business, but here, I feel like I’m at someone else’s beck and call, which is frustrating. I think I need to establish something for myself to gain respect. I don’t feel like continuing here, but I also feel that quitting isn’t the right thing to do. I plan to stay for the rest of the month, but I’m torn. Could my desire to leave just be my neurotic tendencies acting up? Should I suppress this desire, or follow it? Would following it be "doing as I wish"?

A: Do you remember the principle of "accepting nature and doing what one ought to do"? I’ve acted on this principle before, which led me to disclose my symptoms to my classmates. But now I regret it deeply. Perhaps I misunderstood it. For now, I interpret it as this: when there’s something you want to do that is feasible and appropriate in the moment, you should follow that urge. Is this understanding correct?

Tianji: There’s nothing wrong with wanting to start your own business, but do you think you have enough experience? Many successful business owners started with ordinary jobs to gain experience.

Feeling uncomfortable at your sister’s place because of the lack of independence is understandable. But if you give up just because of minor discomfort, do you think you’ll be able to handle bigger challenges in the future?

You’re mistaken about "acting as one wishes." It doesn’t mean following constructive urges—it means doing whatever you please, including harmful or destructive actions. By contrast, "acting as one ought" means doing what needs to be done, what is right. These two ideas are fundamentally different.

September 20, 2012
A: Senior, to be honest, do you think I come across as fake? My close friends have been drifting away from me, and it makes me sad.

A: I feel like I’m unable to live as my true self. Every day feels exhausting. Even though I can now force myself to "act as I ought," I still feel miserable at times. What should I do?

A: I just had a heartfelt conversation with a good friend. I realized I’d made a lot of mistakes and suddenly gained some insights. It was very rewarding.

Tianji: If you’re not willing to treat others sincerely, how can you expect them to treat you sincerely?

Also, I want to point out an earlier mistake of yours. After I criticized you, you felt uncomfortable—which is perfectly normal. No one feels good about being criticized. But your mistake was focusing only on your discomfort. You thought about venting instead of reflecting on why I criticized you.

If your friends criticize you and you respond the same way, they’re bound to drift away. I’m not saying this to scold you, but to help you recognize what you’re doing wrong and what needs to change.

September 27, 2012
Tianji: I used to take medication, but the more I took, the more dependent I became. Medication can provide temporary relief, but excessive use leads to significant side effects. If you feel overwhelmed, you can take some, but only in moderation and only for a short period.

As for the pain you’re experiencing, there’s no way around it. Stop looking for methods to eliminate it—it will only make things worse. Don’t think about escaping it either. Face it head-on.

Also, keep yourself occupied. If you idle around, you’ll feel even emptier, and the symptoms will worsen.

September 28, 2012
A: Senior, I realized that there’s a big difference between doing things actively and doing them passively. If I’m going to read psychology books, I think it’s better to space out the reading. What do you think?

A: When I’m physically tired, is it okay to just do what I can? To try my best, even if it’s something small?

Tianji: Yes, books on Morita Therapy can be read intermittently—you don’t need to read them all at once.

If you feel physically exhausted, rest or do something relaxing, like listening to music. There’s no fixed way you must do things.

The translation will continue below.

October 2, 2012
A: Senior, I wanted to ask: when I complete a task, I often feel dissatisfied with my performance or state during the process. However, the task is done. Should I focus on the fact that "it’s completed" and move on to the next thing, or should I reflect on what I did wrong and how I can improve?

Tianji: Both approaches are valid. If you recognize areas for improvement, avoid making the same mistakes in the future. However, don’t let reflection hold you back from moving forward. You can reflect while beginning the next task.

October 14, 2012
A: Senior, I’m currently taking medication, but it feels like it’s no longer effective. I’m still in pain. This process is so difficult. I feel incredibly unlucky. My mind is chaotic, and I don’t want to read psychology books anymore because I feel like they’ve confused me. I just want to escape. Why does my life have to be this unfortunate?

Tianji: You’re not the only one who feels unfortunate. There are countless others in similar situations, so stop wallowing in self-pity—it will only make things worse.

If you don’t want to read psychology books or take medication, it’s like resigning yourself to staying stuck in your current state. That’s a very passive and negative mindset, and it will only prevent you from recovering. You’re not confused by the books; you simply haven’t grasped the truths they contain.

Whenever you encounter problems, feel free to talk to me. But please refrain from constantly saying how painful and unlucky you feel—that kind of talk won’t help.

A: Understood.

December 30, 2012
A: Senior, I’ve been reflecting on how to read books about Morita Therapy. Recently, I realized that many things in life shouldn’t be forced or over-structured. Instead, they should be approached naturally. For example, when reading, I think it’s fine as long as I don’t experience symptoms while reading. Also, thank you for accompanying me and helping me through my most difficult times. I’m mentally prepared now. No matter what challenges come, I’ll face them head-on and never choose to escape again.

Tianji: I’ve already explained how to read Morita Therapy books: spend 30 minutes to an hour daily and periodically reread each book, especially The Way of Self-Discovery and Realization. With careful reading, your neurosis will gradually be eased.

Often, we exaggerate our difficulties. I used to do the same, thinking my challenges were insurmountable. Later, I realized they were just like a thin piece of paper—easily pierced with a single finger.

February 3, 2013
A: Senior, I’ve been keeping myself busy lately, and I’ve realized that staying focused on tasks feels best. When I’m fully engaged in doing something, I completely forget about my symptoms. But recently, I’ve noticed I’ve become very irritable and easily angered, especially when others criticize me. Rationally, I know I shouldn’t care, but emotionally, I can’t help it and even get angry. Should I suppress my anger and temper? Regardless, I’m committed to staying busy every day—it makes me feel hopeful!

Tianji: It’s normal to feel uncomfortable when others criticize you. You don’t need to suppress your feelings deliberately. However, whether or not you lose your temper is a different matter. We all know that lashing out at others is unhelpful. So, let yourself feel angry, but avoid venting it on others. As you stay occupied with tasks, those negative feelings will naturally fade away.

A: So, we should restrain ourselves from venting at others but allow our feelings to run their natural course?

A: Also, I’ve noticed that while I’m working, I feel at my best. But when I’ve completed everything and have nothing left to do, I start overthinking again. Sometimes, to avoid this, I even try to find something to do. For example, now I’m lying in bed watching a movie because I have nothing else to do, but I still find myself overthinking and feeling unmotivated. What should I do? Should I keep finding things to do?

Tianji: Are you saying you want to live your entire life without ever overthinking again? Let me tell you, that’s impossible. Ask anyone—they’ve all had random thoughts.

When there’s truly nothing to do, take a break or enjoy some entertainment. If you catch yourself overthinking again, let the thoughts come and go. Time will pass, and you’ll eventually stop thinking about it. Remember, moderation is the way to go.

A: Understood. Thank you.

February 8, 2013
A: Senior, sometimes I force myself to do something, even though I clearly can’t manage it. I tell myself it’s something I must do and push myself relentlessly. But the result is that things get worse and worse. Am I misunderstanding the concept of "acting as one ought"? Should I put that difficult task aside and focus on something else for now?

Tianji: Do what you can and do it well. If something truly exceeds your abilities, there’s no need to force yourself.

I remember a couple of years ago, my family encouraged me to study software development. I gave it a try but ended up learning nothing despite my efforts. Eventually, I realized it wasn’t the right field for me. So, I let it go and pursued something else.

Remember, no one is omnipotent. You can’t do everything, but what you can do, you should strive to do well.

A: Understood.
